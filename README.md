# Personal Website

I am by no means a professional or experienced front end developer.
Although I am mainly interested in systems operating systems and
experienced in system programming at the network level, I have always been
totally blown away by a great portfolio website. In these examples, you
see the talent, complexity, and design sense of these developers. JavaScript
and its friends often get a bad rap on tech YouTube and other social media
sites, but its been the JS community that has informed many recent
developments in systems programming. Namely, the adoption of a first class
package manager in Rust. I also believe JS devs helped popularize the concept
of linting and formatting dotfiles.

This is my foray into web development. The main technologies used here, and
that make this site possible, are NextJS, TailwindCSS, and FramerMotion.
For hosting, I am using Vercel, and my personal domains I license manually
on Route53.
