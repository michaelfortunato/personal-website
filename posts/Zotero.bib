  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have been extremely successful in
              the image recognition domain because they ensure equivariance with
              respect to translations. There have been many recent attempts to
              generalize this framework to other domains, including graphs and
              data lying on manifolds. In this paper we give a rigorous,
              theoretical treatment of convolution and equivariance in neural
              networks with respect to not just translations, but the action of
              any compact group. Our main result is to prove that (given some
              natural constraints) convolutional structure is not just a
              sufficient, but also a necessary condition for equivariance to the
              action of a compact group. Our exposition makes use of concepts
              from representation theory and noncommutative harmonic analysis and
              derives new generalized convolution formulae.},
