# AI Policy

I am a firm believer in the below policy from [MrIceman](https://github.com/MrIceman/),
and I encourage everyone to copy the same policy and add it to their OnAI.md file.

## AI not welcome here

> Because of my own personal philosophy regarding technology and AI, all the code in this repository that was written by me - I wrote 100% on my own.
> There is and will be no usage of Github Co-Pilot or any other AI tool.
> I became a software developer because of my passion for our craft - Software Engineering.
> I build this tool because I enjoy programming.
> Every single line of code you'll read in this repo, that was written by me, is produced first in my mind and then manifested into reality through my hands.
> I encourage any contributor to follow the same principle, though I can't and don't want to put any restrictions on this.
> Just like people stopped walking because they commute by cars and trains, which caused an increase in obesity and illness,
> I believe that the massive usage of AI will cause people to stop thinking and using their minds and the resulting havoc is unthinkable.
> [MrIceman][1]
